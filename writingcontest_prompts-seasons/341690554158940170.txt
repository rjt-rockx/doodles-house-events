-Winter-
The glittering snow shone like a heaven long forgotten.
Trees surrounded the icy lake as if it were a fairy tail.
Infatuated by their surroundings, the person looked up to the white, soothing sky.
With seemingly perfect timing, a new wave of snowflakes fell. Floating like feathers in the wind they scattered along the ground, with some brushing over the persons face.
It was only then that the tears began to fall.
The person couldn't feel the snow at all. They couldnt touch it. Couldn't smell it.
Everything was fake.
For the beauty of winter had been destroyed long ago.
