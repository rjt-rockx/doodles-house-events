:AstolfoCool: Winter :AstolfoCool:

You ever just wanna write your name? But you cant and you’re sad, as you don’t have a pencil. Writing on snow with a pencil? Hell I have a pencil right here. The snow is now yellow and I waddle into the cabin. Now it is night time. I lay warm inside. I don’t believe I got it all out earlier, but it is too warm to leave the bed, also its scary out there. I let loose the dam and it spreads through the sheets. An hour later, I am cold and sad now. My Winter.. isnt very Merry.
