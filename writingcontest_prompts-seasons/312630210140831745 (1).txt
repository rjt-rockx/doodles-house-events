A day like no other has come upon my young mind. Walking the halls for the very last time. Seeing the twisted faces of concentration, as students gear up to prove themselves to the system that's raised them. Sneaking out of homeroom to spend time with my fellow man. Disregarding the responsibilities I'm expected to have with no back up preplanned. My mind cloudy with excitement with unmade decisions arriving, choosing how to enter the world with my work shoes striding. As the public panics with conspiracy a brew, the government implements policy many people find shrewd. No manner of hardship can stop us now, for the testament to our efforts is not one many can say will make them proud. Sanitizer and Clorox fill my lungs in an effort to curtail the plague that's begun. I get dressed in cap and gown, as those before me remind me of the path I've gone down. As I look back on the prison that confined my expression, and recall memories of the good, bad, fun and depression. My bonds that I've made and broken bring a tear to my eye. I seek to begin life anew and remember phase one with a sigh. As my smiling faculty present expensive paper with superficial meaning, most kids in these chairs only think of celebratory drinking. But with a new path open at my feet, my pollen allergy attacks with no sign of defeat. My route is arduous and ever expansive, making short work of my far sighted advances. As ahead of myself as I may seem, I was promised the world and shall achieve my dreams. With a warm breeze caressing my back, into the trenches of work culture I track. With footprints big enough for those who have yet to come, the path I'm carving is unseen and my victories will go unsung. So step forward to take the world you've been given as I have before, because our future is the present if we miss our chance to get a foot in the door.
Rise to the occasion and let your voice ring as the watching eyes silently crown you their king. The day had come, the fast is over I could finally see the sprout of clover.
