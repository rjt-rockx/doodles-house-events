Autumn is the season when leaves fall.
The trees and the ground are dyed in the sunset. The breeze is too cold for spring and summer, yet too warm for winter. Leaves, stained in bright colours, float to the ground.
Autumn lies on the boundary of Summer and Winter, of life and of rest, of the familiar and the unknown.
But thereâ€™s more to Autumn than the season itself.
An unexpected meeting with old friends. Hot chocolate with marshmallows. Small campfires on dark nights. Moments and things that are familiar yet foreign.
Nonetheless, these things are beautiful, yet fleeting.
