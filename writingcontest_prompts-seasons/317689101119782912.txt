Pure, unbridled suffering. That is all Fall entails. Sure the weather is nice and shit, but every God damn Georgia football team just CAN’T FUCKING WIN ONE!!! Like seriously! We’ve been so close so many times it just hurts. All Fall makes me think of is football, and that makes it worse. An SEC championship and a National Title to Alabama and a Super Bowl loss when you were up by 15 with NINE MINUTES LEFT!!!! KYLE MOTHERFUCKING SHANAHAN RUN THE FOOTBALL!!! THIS IS WHY YOU LOST TO A WALRUS IN THE SUPERBOWL!!! So yeah that’s fall for me.
