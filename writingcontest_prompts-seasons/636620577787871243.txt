Autumn. You ask what it is for me. How I see it. For me, it is the nostalgic sensation of home.. or what once was. The crunching of leaves under my feet brings me back to the faded joy of coming home.
The laughter I once shared now only echoes in my head. I can still smell the earthy aroma of falling leaves that fluttered atop our heads like crowns. Yes, we felt like kings against the world, but young hearts are often deceived.
 For me, autumn is bittersweet in the memories that it holds.

(I tried to stay under the one hundred word limit, but it was more difficult than I thought. There were many lines that were snipped out that I kinda liked, but I hope this is enough to make sense..? I'm not overly gifted at writing, but I enjoy it nonetheless bc it helps get some "emotional steam" out if y'know what I mean. Lol. Anyways, I hope y'all like it! ^^)
