You step outside and the cold crisp air washes over you as summer is left behind. The trees are painted with different colors of red, yellow, and orange creating a scenery that is normally seen in photos or cards. The sounds of children running around and giggling as they jumped into the crunchy leaf piles. Scents of pumpkin filled your home's walls, autumn was here and gave a
wonderful greeting. The hope it would last forever would overcome you but preparation had to be made for the winter that would overcome this beautiful season.
