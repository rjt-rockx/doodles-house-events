SnowTop suicide
Dazai x Reader story

Two lovers standing on top of a cliff covered in white - it was a tall cliff from a mountain almost as tall as an 8 foot building. They look down and see the ground and trees painted with white, the lake nearby was crystallized in ice, and the sky above showering down particles of cold white dots. The wind was cold and eerie just like the last moments you and Dazai had as you both held hands and fell facing back onto the ground as the cold took over and blood on the snow making it into an eerie painting.
