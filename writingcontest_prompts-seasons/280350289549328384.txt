FALL

A stark shift
A sudden change

Life bursts to flames
Slowly burning out
Leaving nothing but
A crusty shell

So beautiful
Yet bittersweet

But-
But this change,
It's for the better
Or rather
It is inveitable

Cherish them,
[these moments]
While you can.

As the leaves weaken
They drop like tears
One after the other.

Let them f

            .
               Sink

          .

    .
     Flutter
            down
         .
   . . .
And await the snow
To numb your woes.
