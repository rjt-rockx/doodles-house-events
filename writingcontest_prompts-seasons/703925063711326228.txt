Just when the sun has arose from slumber, the shining light reflects on the snow, fair as snow white. The leaves grunge in and swift in the air. Thin air bypasses. The smell of snow flows into my nostrils. The creamy smell of hot cocoa from the living room next to the fireplace makes me hungry. The warm crackling voice of the fireplace makes me joyous. The taste of hot cocoa makes my salivary mouth feel blessed. And outside I go, the drops of white cotton blesses the day. The snow drifts everywhere. This day could not be any better!
