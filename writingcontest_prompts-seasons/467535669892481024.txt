Spring is when the flowers bloom; You see them everywhere. When spring came, you were there. You were the reason I was so happy then, the reason why I love spring so much. When spring came, you melted the sadness that winter caused. But with spring, comes the destruction of flowers and by the next month of spring, the flowers aren't there anymore. And just like flowers, you didn't stay long. But I hope by next spring, you'll come again and weâ€™ll start all over, just like spring flowers. I love spring because of you. I love you so much.
