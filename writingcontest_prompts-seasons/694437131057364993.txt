*winter *:umbrella2:
In this moment,
I would love nothing more than to
Dance in that icy rain,
But as I am with you,
I shall indeed refrain.
As you are my one and only,
My light and shining star
To clear away the dark clouds,
And bring the rain no more.
To bundle up in thick coats,
Or just sip cocoa by fire.
Whether music plays or not,
You remain the only one I truly desire.
So dance with you, I shall,
Instead of with the rain.
For you are the one,
The only one who keeps me warm and sane.
