~Winter~

The air is like a bite on your skin

The scenery a blinding white

Every white drop is like a small sign of hope,
as it’s frosty being joins it’s friends

Does it know it is a sign of hope?

Does it know it’s frosty bite can hurt if we are to meet for too long?

Does it know when it joins it’s friends we get to see its true beauty as it fills the ground with the purest of white?

We will never know for it never tells it’s secrets of which it quietly shares among the pine trees
