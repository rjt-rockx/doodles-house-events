winter :

When geese head south,
a milky universe is created.

It's calling out,
the howling wind.

Was it a message,
a cry, a call.

Admire the crackling of the trees,
along with the falling of the frozen leaves.

Glistening in the sky,
like fairy lights.

Twirling and twisting,
as though it was doing a Pirouette.

Let the frost rest on your face,
sense the chill against your skin.

Look, nature, how beautiful.
Let her lead you into the frosty fantasy.

When the ice melts,
a new cycle begins.
